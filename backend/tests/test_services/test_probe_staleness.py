"""A probe going quiet must never leave its hosts looking healthy.

This is the failure this feature could most easily introduce. A host's status is
the newest row in ``ping_checks``, with no age check. That holds while the core
is the only writer, because the self-check's global freshness source notices if
it stalls. Add probes and that reasoning breaks: one probe can die while the
core and the other probes keep writing, the global stream stays fresh, and every
host behind the dead probe keeps rendering its last known state.

If those hosts were up, they stay green — with nothing checking them, and
nothing saying so. These tests exist to make that impossible.
